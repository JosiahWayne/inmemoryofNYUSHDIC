Our team is a diverse and warm community, where people with different abilities and interests join their efforts to try to make the world a better place, a place where digital innovative technology can be better adopted by humans. We are from freshman to graduate students, from the north to the south in China, and their majors are from IMA, CS to Businessâ€¦

We are diverse. But we are also harmonious and colorful. Our team atmosphere is always warm, chill, but also productive. We have a strong spirit of cooperation, communication, and compassion. Every member is responsible for their work and is chasing the same goal of building a limitless future for NYUSHDIC.
