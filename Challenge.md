NYUSH Digital Innovation Challenge, also known as NYUSHDIC, is a project-oriented innovation competition where participants apply media technology to solve real-world business problems.

We are composed of an annual big competition every fall, a lot of tutorial workshops, and some creative small events each year.

Here is a report you can see about NYUSHDIC 2023 from NYUSH official website.
